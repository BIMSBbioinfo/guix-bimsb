     "DiNuP compares the nucleosome profiles generated by high-throughput
sequencing between different conditions.  DiNuP provides a statistical p-value
for each identified region of differential nucleosome positioning (RDNP) based
on the difference of read distributions.  It also empirically estimates the
false discovery rate as a cutoff when two samples have different sequencing
depths and differentiate reliable RDNPs from the background noise.")

    (description
     "RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the
most used function in the package.  Three kinds of dynamic programming
algorithms for structure prediction are provided: the minimum free energy
algorithm of Zuker & Stiegler (1981) which yields a single optimal structure,
the partition function algorithm of McCaskill (1990) which calculates base
pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the suboptimal folding
algorithm of Wuchty et.al (1999) which generates all suboptimal structures
within a given energy range of the optimal energy.  For secondary structure
comparison, the package contains several measures of
distance (dissimilarities) using either string alignment or
tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990).  Finally, an algorithm to design
sequences with a predefined structure (inverse folding) is provided.")
