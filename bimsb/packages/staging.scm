    (description
     "BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a
large reference genome, such as the human genome.  It consists of three
algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM.  The first algorithm is
designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for
longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp.  BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar
features such as long-read support and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is
the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster
and more accurate.  BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for
70-100bp Illumina reads.")
